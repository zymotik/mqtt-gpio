# MQTT to GPIO node library

Quick and simple library to get a node topic setting state on a Raspberry Pi GPIO pin.

In my use case, I'm using Home Assistant climate app to turn on a heating zone relay. 

Look at my other node packages for code to publish OneWire events to MQTT topics for Home Assistant.
